# Online Restaurant Table Booking Service

This project is an online booking system for restaurant tables. It allows users to reserve tables by selecting a date, time, and table from a restaurant map, and then completing a form to finalize the reservation. Managers can view and manage reservations, including filtering, updating, and canceling them. The system also generates a ticket with a barcode for users to present at the restaurant entrance.
